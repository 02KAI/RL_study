### **Evaluation**

**Criteria**:  

- **Methods Used**  
- **Quality of Results**  
- **Analysis and Discussion**  
- **Presentation Quality**  
- **Q&A**  

Consider the following aspects:  

- Are you using appropriate techniques and approaches for the chosen task?  
- Does your work demonstrate proficiency in advanced RL techniques?  
- What steps have you taken to improve performance?  

Note: The difficulty of the chosen problem is **not** a part of the evaluation.  
Peer evaluation details will be announced later.

### **Coding**

- You may use existing libraries as subroutines, but you must integrate them appropriately.  
- Be prepared to tweak algorithms to analyze performance under different settings.
